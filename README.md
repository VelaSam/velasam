🧙‍♂️ Samuel Velasco — Full-stack polymath | Neovim cultist | JS necromancer | Web3 non-believer

🐧 I use Arch Linux, btw. Compiled my kernel before I could walk.

⌨️ Neovim isn’t just a text editor — it’s a lifestyle. Treesitter syntax-highlights my soul.

🧠 I don’t "code" websites. I compose front-end symphonies in TypeScript, React, Angular, Svelte, and whatever else is trending this week on Hacker News.

🎨 CSS? Tailwind. Design system? I invent one per project.

📦 Webpack, Vite, esbuild? I configure them from scratch because I don't trust GUIs.


🔭 Currently building an overengineered static site generator in Zig to replace my old Next.js blog that was too mainstream.

🌱 Learning how to self-host my own CI/CD pipeline on a cluster of Raspberry Pis running NixOS, just because I can.

🚫 No Copilot. I am the Copilot.

🧵 All my side projects are monorepos. My dotfiles are version-controlled and follow a 3-branch release strategy.

🌐 My browser has 15 privacy extensions and a userscript that auto-closes sites using Tailwind badly.

🖼️ I judge people based on their font choices. If you use Fira Code, we’re friends. If you use Monaco, we need to talk.


🎸 When I’m not rewriting my blog for the 7th time this year, I climb walls and play guitar solos that are easier to read than most developers’ CSS.

🧪 Occasionally teach undergrad CS labs but end up rewriting half the material because pedagogy is for the weak.

🪬 Web dev by day, digital minimalist by night. Yes, my window manager has no title bars.

📟 I once wrote a bash script that mocked systemd.


📫 svelasco514@gmail.com – yes, that’s Gmail. I'm not that far gone. Yet.
